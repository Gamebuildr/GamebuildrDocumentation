#### tl;dr

[Issues/feature requests](https://github.com/herman-rogers/gamebuildr_issues/issues)

[Gamebuildr Documentation](http://gamebuildrdocumentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?)

Say Hello: contact@gamebuildr.io

### Documentation.

The main documenation can be found at [Gamebuildr Documentation](http://gamebuildrdocumentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?). If reading the docs only is not your thing then continue reading below!

This repository contains all the documentation, requests, and bugs for [Gamebuildr CI](http://www.gamebuildr.io). It is broadly split into two areas: a section for users and a section for developers. The former will help users get up and running with Gamebuildr as a tool integrating into their workflow while the other discusses our application, the technology behind it, and the techniques we use for our current system.

If you want to edit and add documentation then clone this repository, add the necessary files 
(add a .rst file to the top level directory) or edit an existing file, run the command ```make html```, commit your changes and push to master.

### Feedback, Issues, and Feature Requests.

If you have any issues with the application, need help setting something up, or would like to report a bug please raise them in the [issue/feature tracking section](https://github.com/herman-rogers/gamebuildr_issues/issues) of this repository. In addition, if you have any questions, feedback, or feature requests this is also the best place to raise them or by directly contacting Gamebuildr at contact@gamebuildr.io.

###Thanks for your Support!

We're currently working through the beta phase of the application so we're rolling out features at a rapid pace while noting the bugs along the way. We will attempt to address all the questions, issues, and feedback accordingly and, in the end, we hope everyone enjoys Gamebuildr!
